        <p>Why are seeds plants important?<br>
        Seeds are of immense biological and economic importance. They contain high protein, starch and oil reserves that help in
        the early stages of growth and development in a plant. These reserves are what make many cereals and legumes major food
        sources for a large proportion of the world's inhabitants.</p>

        <p>Why should you buy plants?<br>
            Not only do indoor plants enhance the overall appearance of a space, but they've been shown to boost moods, increase
        creativity, reduce stress, and eliminate air pollutants—making for a healthier, happier you. Indoor plants don't just
        look good—they can make us feel good, too.</p>

            We all have lived our childhood by running and playing around trees, watching the beautiful flowers bloom on long
            branches, collected different sized leaves from various trees, peeped from the window to catch a glimpse of the
            twittering birds etc. <br>
            
            If we go down the memory lane a few years ago, we would find that the environment around us was much greener than what
            it is today. <br>
            
            We had green belts on either sides of the road; we had trees lining up on the other end of the green belt on the road.
            Today, these green spaces are made way for road widening activities to accommodate the huge rush of vehicles on the
            road. <br>
            
            If we find green spaces anywhere in cities today, it is only at the handful of gardens and parks that have remained
            unexploited by unreasonable human tasks. <br>
            
            So the future generations are very unlucky since we are providing them with very less green spaces and they only have to
            identify the beauty of nature’s greenery by reading through old chronicles and encyclopedias. <br>

        <div class="box2">
            Permaculture is all about living lightly on the planet, and working with nature to build and manage a sustainable
            ecosystem from which we can comfortably supply many generations to come. <br> But, as with everything in modern society, this
            can only happen if it proves to be cost effective. <br> Seed saving is a great starting point for developing a strong
            foundation for your produce, not only does it build a stronger gene pool, but it also saves you a tonne of money in the
            process. <br>

        <div class="box3">
            We spend money on a whole lot of things. We buy endless money shopping for our favorite things in the market. It’s time
            we think a little about our fellow beings on this earth, especially trees since most of them are usually cut down and
            brought down to earth and we rarely take an effort to re plant them again. <br>
            
            If we cannot spare time for re-planting a tree, there are other means through which we can volunteer ourselves in the
            act of growing more trees. <br>
            
            Let us first see why we need trees around us. Don’t we all need fresh air in our surroundings? We need air to breathe,
            to carry out the process of respiration and generate energy for the body. <br>
            
            Plants carry out photosynthesis and generate food. Oxygen is thus a very essential part of our daily activities and
            these huge lump sum hordes of oxygen are not got by plucking from the atmosphere <br>
